# NymGuardBot

**NymGuardBot** is a Telegram bot designed to verify new users in a chat by conducting a short quiz. The bot helps prevent spam and unwanted bots in your community by blocking users after three failed attempts to answer the questions correctly.

## Features

- **Random Questions:** The bot asks users random questions related to data privacy and security, specifically focused on the NYM company.
- **Response Timeout:** Users have one minute to answer the question. If they don't respond in time, a failed attempt is counted.
- **Automatic Blocking:** If a user answers incorrectly three times or fails to respond in time, they are automatically blocked from the chat.
- **Security:** The bot is ideal for communities that need to maintain a high level of security and protection against spam.
